Once you have copied the folder, you can launch Cinema 4D and check if X-Particles appears under the Plugins menu. If it does, then you have successfully installed it.

A dialog box will appear where you need to enter your name, email address, and serial number. Then click OK and restart Cinema 4D. You should see a message confirming that X-Particles is activated.
